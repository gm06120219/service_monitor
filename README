1.get the result of ubuntu command: ps aux
2.filtering the keyword of the service like: "apache"
3.if it's still have data after filtering, the service was alive, else send e-mail with the log file to your e-mail address.

How to use it:
$sudo vi /etc/init/smonitor.conf
start on started networking
exec sh -c "python /your_unzip_directory/monitor.py > /var/log/smonitor/log.log 2>&1"
$mkdir /var/log/smonitor
$sudo service smonitor start
